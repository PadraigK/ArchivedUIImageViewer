ArchivedUIImageViewer

This is a tiny Mac app for viewing iOS UIImages that have been archived using NSCoding. If there are plain image files in your app's cache folder, this will probably let you view them.

It has been tested with UIImages archived but the simulator on iOS 7, but nothing else. 

Drag and drop files on it to use it. If it can unarchive them, it will display them. If not it won't and will probably just crash.
